\section{Newtonian Noise}
Newtonian noise (NN) is predicted to be one of the limiting noise sources in third-generation detectors at frequencies below 30\,Hz. It is produced by seismic fields, atmospheric sound and temperature fields, and vibrating infrastructure. In second-generation detectors, these disturbances are mostly produced locally, but the natural environment will become more important in third-generation detectors, since, (a), we have learned and will still learn how to build detector infrastructure that does not disturb the environment in the NN frequency band, and/or (b), our targets for NN cancellation might be so ambitious that we do not only care about the dominant local perturbations, but also about weaker disturbances by nature. Therefore, NN research has a potentially big impact on site selection. 

Accordingly, R\&D tasks can be associated with at least four important categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item NN modeling
\item NN mitigation
\item Impact of NN on site selection
\item Impact of NN on detector infrastructure
\end{itemize}
These items further divide according to the various sources of NN, e.g., seismic and atmospheric fields. Today, activities are ongoing in all four categories. Modeling of NN is of course the oldest of these disciplines, and still requires efforts especially to take into account details of local geology for precise NN estimation, as well as for the prediction of atmospheric NN including turbulence and scattering of sound waves. 

Third-generation detectors might be constructed underground or at the surface. The modeling and cancellation of NN will be substantially different in these two cases, which means that R\&D tasks can often be clearly divided into surface and underground as will be done in the following.  We will also group R\&D activities according to the source of disturbance to draw a more coherent picture of a specific field. This means that NN modeling and NN mitigation will be restructured into Mitigation of atmospheric NN and Mitigation of seismic NN. 

\subsection{Current State of the Art}

\paragraph{Mitigation of atmospheric NN}
\begin{itemize}
\item Achieved below 2mHz in gravimeters using pressure sensors
\item NN spectra calculated based on highly-simplified models of sound and temperature fields
\item Correlation studies between microphones carried out at Virgo
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Mitigation of seismic NN}
\begin{itemize}
\item Achieved factor 1000 suppression of seismic signals in seismometers with underground array at Homestake
\item Achieved factor close to 100 suppression of seismic signals in seismometers with surface array at Hanford
\item Achieved factor >10 suppression of tilt signal in cBRS tiltmeter with surface array at Hanford
\item Analytical modeling of NN completed
\item Analytical modeling and numerical optimization of NN cancellation almost complete (missing the case of NN cancellation in underground arrays)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Site selection targets}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ambient seismic noise levels mostly understood from world-wide studies of impact of geology, distance to major cities, and coast
\item Some studies of geology made at existing detector sites and at Homestake
\item Seismic scattering from topography studied in linear order and only to obtain scattering coefficients
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Infrastructure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sound and seismic noise between about 5Hz and 50Hz are dominated by sources that are part of LIGO/Virgo infrastructure (e.g., ventilation)
\item Concrete plans are being developed for infrastructure changes at Virgo to mitigate NN from sound fields 
\end{itemize}

INFN-Genova (numerical simulations of seismic fields), 
Nikhef (numerical simulations and measurements of seismic fields), 
Polgrav (measurements of seismic fields and development of NN cancellation system), 
GSSI (atmospheric and seismic NN modeling and cancellation, sensor array optimization, characterization of seismic fields), 
Caltech (sensor array optimization and development of NN cancellation filters), 
University of Minneapolis (characterization of underground seismic fields), 
INFN-Naples (development of tiltmeter for NN cancellation), 
University of Washington (development of tiltmeter for NN cancellation), 
INFN-Tor Vergata (numerical simulations of seismic fields), 
APC (modeling and cancellation of atmospheric NN, characterization of sound fields),

\subsection{Pathways and required facilities}
I suggest to remove this section from the low-frequency part. Only far-future projects might need specific facilities (e.g., to test LIDAR systems). Also the pathway is not that interesting to describe since the optimal strategy is simply to do everything necessary at once... There is very little dependence between tasks.

\subsection{Type of collaboration required:  small/large}
\begin{itemize}
\item Collaboration is strongly recommended with respect to site characterization. It can take years to understand how to set up high-quality environmental measurements, what is relevant to measure, and how to analyze environmental data.
\item Collaboration is also encouraged for numerical simulations to share generic knowledge, e.g., of how to assess accuracy of numerical simulations (e.g., seismic and atmospheric). 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Suggested mechanisms}

\subsection{Impact/relation to 2G and upgrades}
\begin{itemize}
\item NN cancellation techniques will evolve continuously from 2G to 3G surface detectors. 
\item Solving the problem of NN cancellation in underground 3G detectors is only weakly related to NN cancellation in surface 2G/+ detectors. 
\item Certainly, since we have never actually canceled NN, first experience with this technique in 2G detectors might bring valuable insight, with potentially large impact on 3G NN mitigation strategies.
\end{itemize}
