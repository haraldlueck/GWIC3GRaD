\subsection{Current State of the Art}
In most cases, classical control methods (essentially pole placement) are used to minimize the spectral density of the particular error signal.

There are a few examples of the implementation of more modern techniques:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Global feed-forward of seismic noise to platforms and suspensions

\item $\mu$-Synthesis approach for limited angular control

\item Feed-forward sensor noise subtraction (removal of seismic noise from WFS)

\item Parametric Instability damping by PLL and damping through aliasing of high frequency signals.


\end{enumerate}
