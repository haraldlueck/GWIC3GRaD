\section{Executive Summary}
\label{sec:Exec}

\redtext{(McClelland, Lueck)}

The next generation of gravitational-wave detector will require a tight coordination of R\&D topics.

Within this document, the major topics are described as well as the mechanisms for coordination.

The main conclusions are that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A series of next-gen focused workshops will be held with clearly stated goals and workshop reports to be written and distributed to the GW community.

\item Each of the major R\&D tasks contains a list of stated goals with quantitative metrics as well as timelines.

\item This R\&D program to be updated bi-annually with a snapshot of the current work as well as the expected progress over the upcoming two decades.
\end{enumerate}
